We talked for hours about our favorite books, travel dreams, and discovered we both love the same obscure indie band. <strong>Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly.</strong>",

Our coffee went cold because we were too busy talking. When the staff finally had to close, we realized we'd been there for over 4 hours! It felt like minutes. <em>Walking her home under the stars, I knew something special was beginning.</em>",

When she said yes, the lights seemed to shine even brighter. <strong>We sealed our new relationship with our first kiss under the garden's grand oak tree.</strong> A perfect beginning to our story.",
